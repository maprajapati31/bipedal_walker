# Bipedal Walker Simulation

# Overview
This repository contains all the source code and documentation for the Bipedal Walker Simulation project. The project focuses on simulating a dynamic bipedal robot using Python to analyze its stability and motion dynamics.

# Features

- Dynamic Simulation: Utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, and Math to perform simulations.
- Stability Analysis: Employs Jacobian matrices to perform stability analysis of the bipedal motion.
- Equations of Motion: Derivation of equations of motion for state variables using Lagrangian mechanics.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of the bipedal walker's movement and stability metrics.

# Installation
Prerequisites
